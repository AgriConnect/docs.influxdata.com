InfluxData projects are well suited to be deployed in containers. Containers for each project are published to DockerHub.

- [Telegraf](https://hub.docker.com/_/telegraf/)
- [InfluxDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb/)
- [Chronograf](https://hub.docker.com/_/chronograf/)
- [Kapacitor](https://hub.docker.com/_/kapacitor/)

The source for all containers is available [here](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdata-docker).
