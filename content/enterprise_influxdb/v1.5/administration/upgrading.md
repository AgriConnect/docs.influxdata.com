## Upgrading to InfluxDB Enterprise 1.5 (with TSI enabled)

Version 1.5 includes the first official Time Series Index (TSI) release. Although you can install without enabling TSI, you are encouraged to begin leveraging the advantages the TSI disk-based indexing offers.

For upgrading steps, see [Upgrading to InfluxDB 1.5](/influxdb/v1.5/administration/upgrading/).
