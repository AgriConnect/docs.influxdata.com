## Upgrading from version 1.3.x to 1.3.7
Version 1.3.7 is a drop-in replacement for earlier releases of 1.3.x with no data migration required.

## Upgrading from version 1.2.5 to 1.3.x

Version 1.3.x introduces changes to the data node configuration file and there are changes to the 
underlying communication protocols between the nodes used for hinted handoff.

The impact of the hinted handoff protocol change means that you will be unable to perform a `downgrade` if there are
points contained within the hinted handoff queue of the upgraded nodes.  There are recommendations below which describe
how to avoid building up hinted handoff queue points while upgrading.

Please update that configuration file to avoid any unnecessary downtime.
The steps below outline the upgrade process and include a list of the required configuration changes.

### Step 0: Back up your cluster before upgrading to version 1.3.
It is recommended to create a full backup of your cluster prior to executing the upgrade. If you are 
already have incremental backups being created as part of your standard operating procedures, you should 
trigger a final incremental backup before proceeding with the upgrade.
<dt>
Note that you need to ensure you have sufficient disk space before triggering the backup.
</dt>
The following command uses the [version 1.2 backup syntax](https://docs.influxdata.com/enterprise_influxdb/v1.2/guides/backup-and-restore/#syntax) 
to create an incremental backup of your cluster and it stores that backup in the current directory.

```
influxd-ctl backup .
```

Otherwise, you should create a full backup before proceeding. 
The following command uses the [backup syntax originally introduced in version 1.2](https://docs.influxdata.com/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/guides/backup-and-restore/#syntax) 
to create a full backup of your cluster and it stores that backup in the current directory. 

```
influxd-ctl backup -full .
```
You should start by upgrading the meta nodes first ensuring that the meta cluster is healthy, before proceeding to the
data nodes. 

### Repeat the following steps for each meta node in the cluster

### Step 1: Download the 1.3.7 meta node packages

#### Meta node package download
**Ubuntu & Debian (64-bit)**
```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-meta_1.3.7-c1.3.7_amd64.deb
```

**RedHat & CentOS (64-bit)**
```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-meta-1.3.7_c1.3.7.x86_64.rpm
```

### Step 2: Install the 1.3.7 meta nodes packages

#### Meta node package Install

**Ubuntu & Debian (64-bit)**
```
sudo dpkg -i influxdb-meta_1.3.7-c1.3.7_amd64.deb
```

**RedHat & CentOS (64-bit)**
```
sudo yum localinstall influxdb-meta-1.3.7_c1.3.7.x86_64.rpm
```

### Step 3: Restart the influxdb-meta process

#### Meta node restart
**sysvinit systems**
```
service influxdb-meta restart
```
**systemd systems**
```
sudo systemctl restart influxdb-meta
```

### Step 4: Confirm the upgrade

Once you've performed the upgrade on ALL meta nodes, check your nodes' version numbers using the 
`influxd-ctl show` command.
The [`influxd-ctl` tool](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/features/cluster-commands/) is available on all meta nodes.

```
~# influxd-ctl show

Data Nodes
==========
ID	TCP Address		Version
4	rk-upgrading-01:8088	1.3.7_c1.3.7   # 1.3.7_c1.3.7 = üëç
5	rk-upgrading-02:8088	1.3.7_c1.3.7
6	rk-upgrading-03:8088	1.3.7_c1.3.7

Meta Nodes
==========
TCP Address		Version
rk-upgrading-01:8091	1.2.x_c1.2.y
rk-upgrading-02:8091	1.2.x_c1.2.y
rk-upgrading-03:8091	1.2.x_c1.2.y
```

### Repeat the following steps for each data node in the cluster

### Step 1: Download the 1.3.7 data node packages

#### Data node package download
**Ubuntu & Debian (64-bit)**
```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-data_1.3.7-c1.3.7_amd64.deb
```

**RedHat & CentOS (64-bit)**
```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-data-1.3.7_c1.3.7.x86_64.rpm
```

### Step 2: Remove the data node from the load balancer

In order to avoid downtime and allow for a smooth transition, remove the data node that you plan to upgrade from your
load balancer prior to performing the remaining steps.

### Step 3: Install the 1.3.7 data node packages

#### Data node package install

When you run the install command, your terminal asks if you'd like to keep your 
current configuration file or overwrite your current configuration file with the file for version 1.3.7.
Please keep your current configuration file by entering `N` or `O`;
we update the configuration file with the necessary changes for version 1.3.7 in step 3.

**Ubuntu & Debian (64-bit)**
```
sudo dpkg -i influxdb-data_1.3.7-c1.3.7_amd64.deb
```

**RedHat & CentOS (64-bit)**
```
sudo yum localinstall influxdb-data-1.3.7_c1.3.7.x86_64.rpm
```

### Step 4: Update the data node configuration file

Add:

* [index-version = "inmem"](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#index-version-inmem) to the `[data]` section
* [wal-fsync-delay = "0s"](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#wal-fsync-delay-0s) to the `[data]` section
* [max-concurrent-compactions = 0](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#max-concurrent-compactions-0) to the `[data]` section
* [pool-max-idle-streams = 100](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#pool-max-idle-streams-100) to the `[cluster]` section
* [pool-max-idle-time = "1m0s"](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#pool-max-idle-time-1m0s) to the `[cluster]` section
* the [[anti-entropy]](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#anti-entropy) section:
```
[anti-entropy]
  enabled = true
  check-interval = "30s"
  max-fetch = 10
```

Remove:

* `max-remote-write-connections` from the `[cluster]` section
* the [[admin]](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#admin) section

Update:

* [cache-max-memory-size](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#cache-max-memory-size-1073741824) to `1073741824` in the `[data]` section

The new configuration options are set to their default settings.
Follow the links for more information about those options.

### Step 5: Restart the influxdb process

#### Data node Restart
**sysvinit systems**
```
service influxdb restart
```
**systemd systems**
```
sudo systemctl restart influxdb
```

### Step 6: Add the data node back into the load balancer

Re-add the data node back into the load balancer to allow it to serve reads and writes.
If this is the last data node to be upgraded, proceed to step 7.  

Otherwise, return to step 1 for the data nodes and 
repeat the process for the remaining data nodes.

### Step 7: Confirm the upgrade

Check your nodes' version numbers using the `influxd-ctl show` command.
The [`influxd-ctl` tool](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/features/cluster-commands/) is available on all meta nodes.


```
~# influxd-ctl show

6	rk-upgrading-03:8088	1.3.7_c1.3.7
