Other installation options are available for certain users looking to deploy
InfluxDB Enterprise in specific environments.

To evaluate InfluxDB Enterprise in your local environment, 
you can follow the [QuickStart installation](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.6/quickstart_installation) to create a 2-server cluster that you can explore how an InfluxDB Enterprise cluster works and test some of the functionality available in InfluxDB Enterprise clusters.  
Please note that if you install InfluxDB Enterprise with the QuickStart Installation process, you
will need to reinstall InfluxDB Enterprise with the Production Installation process before using the product in a production environment.

## Google Marketplace

InfluxDB Enterprise is currently available on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Marketplace as a BYOL (bring your own license) offering.
