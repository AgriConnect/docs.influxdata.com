title: High Availability

## [Clustering](/influxdb/v0.13/high_availability/relay/)
Open-source InfluxDB does not support clustering.
For high availability or horizontal scaling of InfluxDB, please investigate our
commercial clustered offering,
[InfluxEnterprise](https://portal.influxdata.com/).

## [Relay](/influxdb/v0.13/high_availability/relay/)
Relay adds a basic high availability layer to InfluxDB.
With the right architecture and disaster recovery processes, this achieves a
highly available setup.
