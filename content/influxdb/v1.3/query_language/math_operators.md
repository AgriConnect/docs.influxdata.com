Mathematical operators follow the standard order of operations.
That is, *parentheses* take precedence to *division* and *multiplication*, which takes precedence to *addition* and *substraction*.
For example `5 / 2 + 3 * 2 =  (5 / 2) + (3 * 2)` and `5 + 2 * 3 - 2 = 5 + (2 * 3) - 2`.

## Supported Operators

### Addition

You can add a constant.

```sql
SELECT "A" + 5 FROM "add"
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM "add" WHERE "A" + 5 > 10
```

You can add together other field keys.

```sql
SELECT "A" + "B" FROM "add"
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM "add" WHERE "A" + "B" >= 10
```

### Subtraction

You can subtract a constant.

```sql
SELECT 1 - "A" FROM "sub"
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM "sub" WHERE 1 - "A" <= 3
```

You can subtract one field key from another field key.

```sql
SELECT "A" - "B" FROM "sub"
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM "sub" WHERE "A" - "B" <= 1
```

### Multiplication

You can multiply by a constant.

```sql
SELECT 10 * "A" FROM "mult"
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM "mult" WHERE "A" * 10 >= 20
```

You can multiply by other field keys.

```sql
SELECT "A" * "B" * "C" FROM "mult"
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM "mult" WHERE "A" * "B" <= 80
```

Multiplication distributes across other operators

```sql
SELECT 10 * ("A" + "B" + "C") FROM "mult"
```

```sql
SELECT 10 * ("A" - "B" - "C") FROM "mult"
```

```sql
SELECT 10 * ("A" + "B" - "C") FROM "mult"
```

### Division
You can divide by a constant.

```sql
SELECT 10 / "A" FROM "div"
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM "div" WHERE "A" / 10 <= 2
```

You can divide by other field keys.

```sql
SELECT "A" / "B" FROM "div"
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM "div" WHERE "A" / "B" >= 10
```

Division distributes across other operators

```sql
SELECT 10 / ("A" + "B" + "C") FROM "mult"
```

## Operators with Functions

The use of mathematical operators inside of function calls is currently unsupported.
Note that InfluxDB only allows functions in the `SELECT` clause.

For example

```sql
SELECT 10 * mean("value") FROM "cpu"
```
will work, however
```sql
SELECT mean(10 * "value") FROM "cpu"
```
will yield a parse error.

> **Note:** Starting with version 1.2, InfluxQL supports [subqueries](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#subqueries) which offer similar functionality to using mathematical operators inside a function call.
See [Data Exploration](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#subqueries) for more information.

## Unsupported Operators

### Inequalities

Using any of `=`,`!=`,`<`,`>`,`<=`,`>=`,`<>` in the `SELECT` clause yields empty results for all types.
See GitHub issue [3525](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/issues/3525).

### Miscellaneous

Using any of `%`, `^` will yield a parse error.
If you would like to see support for these operators open an [issue](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/issues/new).

## Logical Operators are Unsupported

Using any of `&`,`|`,`!|`,`NAND`,`XOR`,`NOR` will yield parse error.

Additionally using `AND`, `OR` in the `SELECT` clause of a query will not behave as mathematical operators and simply yield empty results, as they are tokens in InfluxQL.
