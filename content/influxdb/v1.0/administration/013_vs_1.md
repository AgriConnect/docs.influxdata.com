This page aims to ease the transition from InfluxDB 0.13 to InfluxDB 1.0.
It is not intended to be a comprehensive list of the differences between the versions.
See [InfluxDB's Changelog](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for detailed release notes.

### Sections:

* [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes)
* [`SHOW FIELD KEYS` returns fields' data types](#show-field-keys-returns-fields-data-types)
* [Modified name for the auto-generated retention policy](#modified-name-for-the-auto-generated-retention-policy)
* [New InfluxQL syntax introduces casting and differentiating between identical field and tag keys](#new-influxql-syntax-introduces-casting-and-differentiating-between-identical-field-and-tag-keys)
* [InfluxQL function updates](#influxql-function-updates)
* [Logging change](#influxdb-logging-change)
* [Add support for JWT token authentication](#jwt-token-authentication)
* [Add tsm file export to influx_inspect tool](#influx-inspect-export)

### Breaking Changes

* `max-series-per-database` was added with a default of 1M but can be disabled by setting it to `0`. Existing databases with series that exceed this limit will continue to load but writes that would create new series will fail.
* Config section `[cluster]` has been replaced with `[coordinator]`
* Config sections `[collectd]` and `[opentsdb]` have been renamed `[[collectd]]` and `[[opentsdb]]`.
* Config option `data-logging-enabled` in `[data]` has been renamed to `trace-logging-enabled` and defaults to `false`.
* The keywords `IF`, `EXISTS`, and `NOT` where removed for this release.  This means you no longer can or need to specify `IF EXISTS` for `DROP DATABASE` or `IF NOT EXISTS` for `CREATE DATABASE`.  If these are specified, a query parse error is returned.
* The `SHOW STATS` Shard stat `writePointsFail` has been renamed to `writePointsErr` for consistency with other stats.

### `SHOW FIELD KEYS` returns fields' data types

Starting with InfluxDB version 1.0, the `SHOW FIELD KEYS` query also returns the
field's data type.

Example query:
```
> SHOW FIELD KEYS FROM all_the_types
```

Version 0.13 output:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Version 1.0 output:

```
name: all_the_types                  name: all_the_types
-------------------                  -------------------
fieldKey                             fieldKey  fieldType
blue                                 blue      string
green                                green     boolean
orange                               orange    integer
yellow                               yellow    float
```

See
[Schema Exploration](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/schema_exploration/#explore-field-keys-with-show-field-keys)
for further documentation.

### Modified name for the auto-generated retention policy

Starting with version 1.0, the auto-generated retention policy on a new database will be named `autogen` rather than `default`.

### New InfluxQL syntax introduces casting and differentiating between identical field and tag keys

In versions prior to 1.0, users
[were unable](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues/4630) to query data
that had matching tag keys and field keys.
The new `<identifier>::<field,tag>` syntax allows users to differentiate between
tag keys and field keys with the same name.
See [Data Exploration](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/data_exploration/#the-basic-select-statement)
for an example query.

The `::` syntax also offers new casting functionality; users can cast field
values from integers to floats or from floats to integers.
Check out [Data Exploration](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/data_exploration/#data-types-and-cast-operations-in-queries) for more information.

### InfluxQL function Updates

#### Using a wildcard with aggregation functions

InfluxDB 1.0 supports using a wildcard (`*`) with
[aggregation functions](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/functions/) to specify all
fields in the targeted measurement.

Example:
```
> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "web"
name: web
---------
time   count_click   count_ratings   count_user
0      37            9               17
```

See [Functions](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/functions/) for more examples.

#### New functions

InfluxDB 1.0 offers a new InfluxQL predictor function.
`HOLT_WINTERS()` returns a user-specified number of predicted values for a
single field using the [Holt-Winters](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/7/5) seasonal
method.

See [Functions](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/functions/#holt-winters) for an
explanation of the `HOLT_WINTERS()` syntax and an example query.

Mode has also been added. See [Functions](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/functions/#mode) for an
explanation of the `MODE()` syntax and an example query.

### InfluxDB logging change

Starting with version 1.0, InfluxDB on systemd systems will no longer
write files to `/var/log/influxdb` by default, and will now use the
system configured default for logging (usually journald).  On most
systems, the logs will be directed to the systemd journal and can be
accessed with the command:

```
sudo journalctl -u influxdb.service
```

Please consult the systemd journald documentation for configuring
journald.

See [Logs](/influxdb/v1.0/administration/logs/) for more information.

### JWT Token Authentication

JWT Token Authentication support has been added to the query api.
See [Set Up Authentication](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/authentication_and_authorization/#set-up-authentication)

### Influx Inspect Export

The influx inspect tool now supports the ability to export data directly from a shard.
See [Influx Inspect](/influxdb/v1.0/tools/influx_inspect/) for more information.
