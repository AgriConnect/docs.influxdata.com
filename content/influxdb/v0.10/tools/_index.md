## [InfluxDB Web Admin](/influxdb/v0.10/tools/web_admin/)

The built-in web administration GUI is a simple way to interact with InfluxDB.
For any significant use, whether writing or querying data, the HTTP API is the preferred method.

## [Grafana Graphs and Dashboards](/influxdb/v0.10/tools/grafana/)

Almost all Grafana documentation for InfluxDB version 0.9 will apply to InfluxDB version 0.10.
