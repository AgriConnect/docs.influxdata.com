The closed source versions of Chronograf (versions 0.4, 0.10 through 0.13, and 1.0) are deprecated and are no longer supported or developed.
Users can continue to use the deprecated product; the documentation is available under the Deprecated header in the sidebar.
For more information, please read the original [announcement blog](https://www.influxdata.com/announcing-the-new-chronograf-a-ui-for-the-tick-stack-and-a-complete-open-source-monitoring-solution/) by our CTO, Paul Dix.

We highly recommend moving to the open source Chronograf product. Itâ€™s pretty great, we promise! Check out the [Getting Started](/chronograf/latest/introduction/getting-started/) guide to get up and running!
